## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic software developer in a career transition. With knowledge of front-end and back-end languages, using mainly JavaScript and C# in my academic and corporate daily life. I look for opportunities to learn more and develop myself in this area that I am completely passionate about.

## Technologies I Work With

In my current role, I leverage JavaScript to interact with APIs, handle data processing, and enhance user experiences. 
- **C#**: My go-to language for building robust and efficient applications. 
- **.NET**: I love leveraging the power of the .NET framework to create scalable solutions. 
- **SQL**: Proficient in designing and managing databases using MySQL.
- **Azure**: Familiar with cloud services and deployment on Microsoft Azure. 
- **Git**: Version control is essential, and Git helps me collaborate effectively.
